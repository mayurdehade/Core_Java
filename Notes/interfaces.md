### Interface in Java

An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.

The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in java.

1. Interfaces can have abstract methods and variables.
2. It cannot have method body.
3. It provides total abstraction.
4. All the methods in an interface are declared with the emtpty body, and all filed are public, static and final by default.
5. It cannot be instantated just like the abstract class.
6. Interface can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.

**Interface can have default and static methods (Java 8)**  
**Interface can have private methods also (Java 9)**

An interface is declared by using the interface keyword. It provides total abstraction; means all the methods in an interface are declared with the empty body, and all the filed are public, static and final by default.  
A class that implements an interface must implements all the methods declared in the interface.
